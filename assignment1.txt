DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SIGNED AND UNSIGNED INT

The main difference between signed and unsigned integer is that the starting bit of the integer in binary format decides whether it is a positive or negative value in signed integer, so
there are no negative values in unsigned integers which means if signed integer has values from -255 to 256 , unsigned would have 0 to 256*2 capacity.

So if we already know that program doesnt need negative integers we can use unsigned integer which would save a lot of unused memory.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GO AND JAVA

There are some important differences which are go is easy to code because java is invented long back and there are many packages , so the learning curve is more in java.
the next main thing would be java program is platform independent because of the jvm but go complies differently for each platform.
next thing would be garbage collection which is better in go than java

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GO AND PYTHON

Python has classes and objects similar to java but go does not have it.
python is dynamically typed it has an interpreter but go is statically typer it has compiler
python supports exceptions, go has no exceptions only errors.
